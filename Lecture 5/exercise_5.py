1. dataset preprocessing:
    - output the dimensions of train and test dataset and size of the images. You can get access to the data by calling .data of the MNIST dataset 
    - Plot the digit distribution using a bar histogram with the function plt.bar()
'''

2. Train a CNN
    - Design an architecture that contains the following:
      Convolutional layer
      MaxPool2D layer
      Fully Connected  layer
      Propout layer
      ReLU Activation Function

    - Achieve at least 95% accuracy in the test dataset by tweaking the architecture and save the model
'''

'''
3. Check results
    - plot the first convolutional layer filters before and after training the model
    - feed the first convolutional layer an image and plot its activations
    - plot some incorrectly labelled data points. Does it make sense why the network was not able to classify those data points?
